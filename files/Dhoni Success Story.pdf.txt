 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India, was a football and badminton enthusiast in his childhood who later took up cricket at the insistence of his football coach. He excelled in wicket keeping, which led to his selection in the Bihar U-19 squad and later the Bihar Ranji Trophy squad. His breakthrough came in 2003 when he scored back-to-back centuries against Pakistan A in Kenya, earning him a spot in the Indian ODI squad for the tour to Bangladesh in 2004/05. Dhoni's career-defining moment came in 2007 when he scored 183 off 145 balls against Sri Lanka, leading India to victory and winning the 'Man of the Series' award. He went on to become the captain of the Indian T20, ODI, and Test teams, leading India to numerous victories, including the inaugural World Cup T20 in South Africa and the 2011 World Cup. Dhoni has been awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and numerous ICC awards, and is one of the most marketable players in the world with yearly earnings of $31 million as of 2013.
